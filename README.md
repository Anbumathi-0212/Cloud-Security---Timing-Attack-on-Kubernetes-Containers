# ⏳ Timing Attacks on Kubernetes: An Exploration

## Overview

This repository focuses on the **vulnerability of Kubernetes-deployed applications to timing attacks**, a lesser-studied security threat. Timing attacks exploit small variations in application response times to reveal sensitive information, such as authentication credentials, potentially leading to serious breaches.

This research highlights the need for improved security measures to protect Kubernetes applications from these timing-based exploits.

## Repository Structure

```
📁 templates/               # Kubernetes template files
├── Dockerfile              # Dockerfile for containerizing the application
├── app.py                  # Vulnerable web app
├── requirements.txt        # Dependencies
├── timing-attack.py        # Script to simulate timing attacks
├── timing-deployment.yaml  # Kubernetes deployment for the app
├── timing-service.yaml     # Kubernetes service for the app
```

## Key Components

- **app.py**: Application containing vulnerabilities to demonstrate timing attacks.
- **timing-attack.py**: A script that simulates timing attacks by analyzing response time variations.
- **Kubernetes YAML files**: Used for deploying the vulnerable application and exposing it via a Kubernetes service.

## Key Findings

- **Vulnerability**: Timing attacks can be used to infer sensitive information from Kubernetes-deployed applications.
- **Mitigation**: Use constant-time algorithms, rate-limiting, and randomized delays to defend against timing attacks.

## How to Deploy and Test

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/timing-attacks-kubernetes.git
   ```

2. **Build Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t timing-attack-app .
   ```

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f timing-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f timing-service.yaml
   ```

4. **Simulate Timing Attack**:
   ```bash
   python timing-attack.py
   ```
Observe how the script exploits the application's response time to infer sensitive information.


## Conclusion

This project highlights the risk of timing attacks in Kubernetes environments and the importance of enhanced security protocols to safeguard sensitive data.

**⚠️ Disclaimer**

This project is intended for research and educational purposes only. The timing attacks simulated here demonstrate vulnerabilities in Kubernetes-deployed applications, but should never be used maliciously or against production systems without proper authorization.
